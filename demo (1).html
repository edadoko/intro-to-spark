And I am not afraid to say that this mouse takes the cake, for $20 it looks like its worth $80. The only issue i had was that the seller sent me a wireless version, but I don&apos;t mind because it works just as well. Also where you see silver on the mouse in reality it is glossy black, and the mouse looks better IRL then in the pictures. I will add on to this review in a month or so to check in.&quot;),\n Row(rating=4.0, review=u&quot;we recently had a baby boy so now the use of my home theater system is on the shelf for awhile.  My wife also is not into big sound so decided to try out these wireless headphones.  at first i almost sent them back because i took the easy route and hooked them into my receivers headphone jack.  The sound was terrible and there was the dreaded hissing noise you get with some wireless electronics.  before packing them up i decided to hook them up into the jacks on the TV. Difference was like night and day.  the sound quality is great and really brings out some of the background sounds and music that you typically don&apos;t notice unless you are in a movie theater.  They aren&apos;t super comfortable for long durations but that can be expected with most headphones.  these come fully recommended.&quot;),\n Row(rating=3.0, review=u&apos;Works good for a boy of 6 and his parents.This game is not really requiring any skills (be it game skills, memory or else). It is still fun but gets repetitive fast.

Very disappointing. The fit was fine, so we still use it to get our monies worth&apos;),\n Row(rating=4.0, review=u&apos;They are screws with square heads, what else do you need to know.

It has the nice bracket that can mount to your bike and you have it for the road.And although the image here doesn&apos;t show it, it does have the gauge, though it isn&apos;t the most accurate gauge (not really a problem when the tire is rated for 55 to 100 PSI).Much like one other reviewer noted, the instructions on how to switch from Schrader to Presta are not very clear and should be researched before fumbling with this blasted thing for hours trying to make it work.And like the title mentions, this isn&apos;t as tiny as the MINI name implies.  When looking for a place to mount it on my bike, I am really running short on ideas.  The obvious places would interfere with pedaling.All that said, it puts air in the tire.  Slowly.  It is double action, but the throw isn&apos;t very much.  And the higher the pressure, the more difficult it is to pump.&quot;),\n Row(rating=5.0, review=u&quot;Perfect for the gym or under a few layers for the chilly morning runs.

I researched bike racks extensively and was relieved when the rack arrived and appeared to be very high quality.  The hardware fittings are oversized, the frame is heavy duty, the padding where the bike frames rest are thick, molded rubber and the velcro straps are about 2inches wide with plenty of length to ensure confidence. There is not a single piece of plastic or cheap material on this bike rack.  It took about 30 minutes to assemble the rack and get it ready for hitch installation.  One glitch I found was that the threads on my rack were reversed.  While the instructions said to screw the bolt from the passenger side through the hitch, mine was clearly too loose after installation.  The rack needs to screw in TIGHT into the hitch.  Luckily I tried to screw it from the drivers side and it worked just fine.  There is minimal clearance between the two pieces once the rack is fully installed.  There is a heavy duty pin that allows for tilting the rack to access the trunk.Now the fun part begins.  Make no mistake, the first time you try to mount your bikes, plan for 45 minutes!  This is a game of Tetris, but once you figure out the right configuration for your bikes, the mounting should take no more than 10 minutes including straps. We ended up putting the 2 kids bikes first then the 2 adult bikes. (yes the kids bikes Require an extension bar.) Keep in mind, there will always be points where the bikes rub together, but you can minimize touch points by moving the pedals to the optimal position.  After that, we used knee and elbow pads as padding between the bikes.  This works like a charm!  The velcro straps allow for a variety of secure positions and we haven't scratched our bikes at all!The last part of securing the bikes includes straps.  It is recommened to strap any bike that uses an extension bar from the bike frame or tire to the bike rack directly.  This provides extra security should the extension bar fail, the bikes will still be strapped to the bike rack.  I usually wrap one long strap around the first pair of bikes securing them to the rack, and attach another strap to the second pair of bikes and rack.  The last strap I use is secured from the bike rack to the roof rack of my SUV.  This is actually a critical part of feeling secure!  This is an anti-sway strap that keeps the entire bike rack from moving too much when you hit a bump in the road or go over a train track.  Trust me, you want to buy this strap!Our first road trip with the bikes fully loaded took us across 4 hours of highway and country roads.  The bikes arrived without a scratch and my nerves were intact too.  We have used the rack now 10+ times and each time it gets easier.  Overall, I highly recommend this bike rack.  It is a very strong and sturdy extension of your vehicle.  The only drawback I see is that it doesn't fold down.  But the single post allows me to mount kids bikes, the tilt function is perfect and easy to use, the strength in design is obvious so I will accept the single drawback happily!"],[0.0,1.0,[1.0,2.0,[],[0.27807505223062257,0.7219249477693774]],"This vacuum is one of the worst vacuums I have ever purchased.

I haven't had any issues sending or receiving messages and phone calls, and it's done everything I need it to do... just not as smoothly as I think it should. I decided to write a review from the perspective of someone who has had the phone long enough to know the bugs.The touch screen worked well for the first month or two, and I finally began to get used to texting on it. Unfortunately over time the phone has become less and less responsive. (And I am not hard on electronics) It still works with a little extra pressure, but this can become frustrating. The touch sensitivity is not 100% accurate either. You'd think after a year I would be used to texting on the number keypad, but the phone frequently thinks I'm typing a key across the screen. Unfortunately, it often thinks I'm hitting the clear button when my finger is a few buttons away. Also, the phone has difficulty sensing touch in some of the menus. I can push a button 10 different ways and it still won't open sometimes.I love Tracfone, and this phone has served its purpose, but I would not recommend it. I finally am getting so fed up with trying to push buttons and navigate menus that I'm getting a different Tracfone without a touch screen.What I do love about this phone is the speaker quality for both calls and the music player. I've also had very few issues with it unlocking in my pocket and making calls. The battery life is phenomenal and will last me five days to a week with moderate usage.If you're going Tracfone (which I recommend because it is so much cheaper than everyone else!) I would suggest avoiding touch screens because they are not quite up to the standard responsiveness that we are used to.

Now, I had enjoyed this the first time I viewed it (holy cow, can it really be 15 years ago? I'm feeling old...), but I'm well aware that it's long been fashionable in some circles to make fun of the film. But you know, I don't think it really deserves it.Oh, there's no doubt the star of the film is the ship; the screenplay itself is less than stellar. It's a bit hokey and clunky and heavy-handed, with no real subtlety or originality. But in one sense, these attributes actually work well with a story set in this era; the simple plot (with a broad portrayal of both good and evil characters) is presented in a fashion similar to how a melodrama would have been depicted back in 1912, whether on-stage or in the earliest short silent films. I found myself thinking that the script really wasn't nearly as bad as many people have made it out to be, over the intervening years since the film was first released.That said, I'm afraid that the film didn't really \"grab\" me as much this time around, as it had when I first saw it when I was a good deal younger. Maybe I'm just getting old and tired and cynical? Or, perhaps it's the fact that I'm not a big fan of any of the actors in the film, and have no interest whatsoever in the two playing the leads. I think if the film featured some acting talent about whom I was enthusiastic, who I was excited to see on the screen, I would have found the film to be considerably more riveting. As it is---eh, I'm not all that thrilled with any of the characters apart from Molly Brown, who I thought was a lot of fun in every one of her too-brief scenes.Hmmm, what can I say---I still enjoy the picture (though it's not one that I'm likely to re-watch often in its entirety) and I do recommend it. However---any film with a running time of over three hours needs to have an intermission! Sitting still that long is too hard on the butt---heh.The 3D conversion was nicely done, but not exceptional. I thought it would be a little more striking, in fact---after the first hour I kind of forgot that I was even seeing it in 3D. But, no real complaints on this score.This re-release may not set any box-office records, but after only a week in theatres it's already easily paid for the 3D conversion process and is making a tidy profit.---SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING---Oh, I do have one huge complaint---and there's probably no need to even post spoiler warnings, because doesn't everyone already know exactly what happens at the end? While I find the very end of the film most touching---haunting, even---the bit that comes before that annoys the heck out of me. I STILL am ticked off that \"old Rose\" threw the priceless blue diamond into the water! I don't care how symbolic it is---explain it any way you like, that was just a stupid and pointless and senseless thing to do to an art object that had huge historical significance. Holy cow, she could have just written out a complete account of her story and packed it up along with the gem---and then upon her death made sure her will specified that the package was delivered to the Smithsonian, or something like that. Man---even writing out these words, and I find I'm getting ticked off all over again! So, that's the one thing that I really hate about this film.Well, now that I'm thinking about the ship, I'm curious to view both the 1950's version ofTitanic(starring Barbara Stanwyck) andA Night to Remember (Criterion Collection)(also from the 1950's). I've seen both films, but it's been a while and I don't have a clear recollection of either..."],[1.0,1.0,[1.0,2.0,[],[0.470299578793539,0.529700421206461]],"Now everybody gets an even sized wedge.Fast and easy eight section wedger.Might even work with tangerines too.Would definitely recommend."],[1.0,1.0,[1.0,2.0,[],[0.2167493799277035,0.7832506200722965]],"Nicer than I expected.

The film was originally scheduled for a 2002 release but it suffered from production and serious financial problems -- the company went bankrupt during post-production. I'm guessing they HAD to slap together something and get it released to make enough money just to pay off all the lawyers.The \"cheesy\" CGI was of the quality found in big-budget TV sci-fi shows of that time (like Star Trek Voyager). The post-production team probably could not afford to buy high-end \"Jurassic Park\" type CGI for a B-movie. The CGI renditions they used are passable on a TV-size screen but come off as absolutely horrid on a 40 foot screen. I suspect this is why much of the film was shot in low-light environments -- don't have to show as much detail.As noted by many, the film also suffered from terrible scripting; don't blame the actors, they have to work with what's placed in front of them.Remember, the movie was based on a Ray Bradbury sci-fi short story written in the 1950's -- long before much was known about how dinosaurs became extinct, or the fact that the Earth suffered numerous mass-extinctions throughout its history. The whole \"butterfly effect\" is absurdly ridiculous especially given the fact the plot has a pyroclastic flow from an erupting volcano wiping out all the local life anyway. Nor can we ignore the giant comet / meteor that wiped out some 90% of all life on the planet 65-million years ago (that probably was not known as a scientific fact when Bradbury wrote the story).Did it ever occur to anyone that maybe the butterfly was SUPPOSED to die and that the \"time-wave\" events depicted in the movie ,in fact, showed the correct version of evolution? Maybe it was Homo Sapiens (and all other primates) who shouldn't be here today? Maybe it was the highly-evolved simian-reptiles who actually made the first journey back to the Jurassic tar-pit and THEY were the ones who screwed everything up in the first place?Never the less, I gave the movie a charitable 3-star rating.

Within 30 minutes of owning the X-E1, I took the best pictures I ever have, and even more important my wife was able to reproduce the same results.

Enjoying even the great special effects of this film isn't enough to make for a really memorable sci-fi experience as it takes an engaging plot to make a good film, even in science-fiction.I don't believe anyone would think of this movie as part of the Alien series or try to compare it with prior Alien films. It obviously represents a \"knock off\" intended to attract from a large number of satisfied customers of the Alien vs Predator magazines. This doesn't mean that it shouldn't be considered good sci-fi film and I purchased the DVD hoping for a satisfying film experience.The story line does a nice job of connecting the film histories of the Alien and Predator races together and linking these two fictional accounts with the history of man on earth in a plausible way. Most people agree that the history of ancient monuments all over the earth appear to have a common link, which is probably one of the sources of the Atlantis myth.If anything I think AVP attempted to recapture the action and line up of good characters from ALIENS. Also, rather than the one-on-one bug hunt of the original film, this movie was about war between a defacto army of humans against an army of Alien creatures and their very dangerous Queen.In terms of special effects I would give this movie four stars, however, I couldn't get all that interested in the basic story and AVP left me with an overall one to two star impression and the feeling I was watching an animated comic book.I must admit that I never had the large screen theater experience and first saw the film on DVD at home. I assumed I would at least like AVP since I own the entire Alien series on DVD and enjoy seeing every one of them over and over again.

It's got it ALL, baby.Let's start with Rob Lowe. Jerry McGuire he ain't. You're never going to see Rob with tears streaming down his cheeks, telling a woman that she \"completes\" him. Rather, you're more likely to find him yanking his clothes out of the closet, pulling out any photos that include him, stuffing it all in a duffel bag and hurling it into a garbage truck as he leaves the former object of his desire alone and naked in bed...just like the opening minutes of \"Bad Influence.\"And yes, I know Rob has taken some \"serious\" roles and has played the \"good guy\" on occasion, but my challenge to you is \"NAME one of those roles.\" I remembered them at the time, and I've forgotten them, pretty much like every other Rob Lowe fan on the planet. We want Evil Rob, and this movie is Pure Evil Rob.I won't offer any spoilers here, but let's just say that if you can't see the major plot twist coming from a mile away, you haven't seen too many movies.James Spader seems like an odd choice to play Lowe's \"good\" doppelganger, the guy who becomes corrupted as Rob introduces him to his own wants and desires. Spader's starred in more than his fair share of \"this guy makes me feel kind of squirmy\" roles. Of course, the only way the corruption of the character's \"innocence\" can appear real is that if it's built on shaky foundations to begin with, and Spader nails it. His character is a \"career guy,\" a \"ladder climber,\" engaged to Marcia Cross, who equally nails the boring, white bread, \"why am I marrying this woman\" object of Spader's luke-warm desire. See, Spader really doesn't want the pot of gold at the end of his rainbow. He wants to ride around in  sporty little car with Evil Rob Lowe and do evil things. And he does. Why do you think the movie is named \"Bad Influence\" instead of \"Two Nice Guys Helping Others?\"The soundtrack is lip-smackin' 80s dee-licious, too. Lots of synthy angst...a highlight being The Nymphs performing \"The Highway\" during Lowe and Spader's first venture into one of the sleazy \"password at the door\" clubs. According to the notes on the YouTube clip of this scene, \"Inger Lorre wrote this song about Richard Ramirez, the \"Night Stalker,\" and the groupies he attracted during his trial.\" Makes it a perfect choice for this movie.I could go on...in detail...but I'm keeping my \"no spoilers\" promise. You probably have a general idea of what this one is all about, and I've tried to convey the flavor without ruining the experience. I love it, I've watched it at least 100 times since its release...it's a \"midnight movie,\" it's sublime junk, it's a career high for Lowe.

For example, a white furby might be better for a young child and a black one for an older child because white furbys have longer fur and also they look a little different than black furbys.Furbys can change their personality suddenly.

There is no way I could have figured out how to install the system from the documentation supplied. I had to get help from someone who is very familiar with the set up of electronics, such as navigation systems, and even he had to muddle through to figure out how to complete the set up due to the poor documentation. One issue we had is that one of the tires we wanted to monitor was already low in pressure and the system wouldn't pick that tire up during the set up.I like the design of the system itself. The monitor can be closed while driving, and then the driver only needs to worry about it if the green light changes to yellow or red. When the car is stopped, the screen can be reviewed to view the details on whatever problem is being detected.

I'm not an audiophile and don't have a Technics 1200 to compare it to, but I do have ears and eyes and hands.  First of all, this unit looks good.  I may be biased because I've wanted a new turntable for over a year and I chose the AT-LP120 very early on in my research, but it does look nice.  I have a couple of friends that DO have the 1200MK2, and they like this turntable.  One of them purchased a 120 to use every day and... because it has the USB out.  He calls it a 1200 clone.  Second, if you pick it up, you'll feel the substantial weight which undoubtably lends to it's steadiness and (so far) unwaivering spin rate.  My old turntable, a Technic SA-202 I've had since 1982, has served me well and still serves as the party starter in the garage (next to the bar and milk crates full of records).  Had to move it down there when the other TT crapped out over 5 years ago, so you can see I really needed a new living room unit.  And of course sound wise, the new AT-LP120 does not dissapoint.  But again, maybe my opinion is biased, because I just love to play an album.  I like sliding out the liner, then the record, smell of the vinyl, slight static that raises the hair on my arms, using the discwasher, then placing the arm manually and hearing that &#34;thump&#34; as the needle settles into the groove.  Then sitting back and listening to a whole side, where I'm not clamoring to find a new song or jumping ahead with a touch screen &#34;click&#34;, is much more enjoyable. You could buy this turntable because it's a good deal, really, for what I paid for the 202 in 1982 (just over $200) you can have a greatly superior model.

A burnt out junkie who is closer to the end of his career than the beginning seems to fit him perfectly.This movie is a heist movie to begin with, and director Neil Jordan shoots it with the appropriate glitz and glamour that a film set in Monte Carlo deserves. He nails the atmosphere, giving the movie a dark, jazzy feel, mixing the styles of the classic films noir and the new reinvention of the style. The plot is good, as it is filled with twists and turns, as any good heist flick should. One thing that should be mentioned is the chemistry between all the characters. The cast is completely European, save Nolte, yet they mesh incredibly well together. The relationship between Bob and Roger the police officer is one of the movie's centerpieces, and their mutual respect and odd friendship is completely believable without too much explanation. Also good in this movie is the girl who plays Anna, and I won't even attempt to spell her name, because it could take up to an hour to get it right.

I have numerous only IDE drives and need to be able to get to old backup files. The Seagate drives I have worked perfectly, while the one Maxtor drive didn't work at all. The Maxtor drive has a wider jumper pin bay between the power plug and the data cable. So it would not insert into the device.  Fortunately I mainly have Seagate drives so that is not a big issue.

The only difference I have really notices is in the drive letter selection. Unlike a thumb drive the hard drive apparently gets a higher priority in the drive letter selection.  So when it is inserted any thumb drive you have inserted into the same device will get shuffled downward and its letter will be given to the new harddrive.

There is one small negative though...I started playing RB again after a 15-year layoff, but liability issues  (and common sense) now require eyewear at every gym. I generally don't like this kind of thing, but I'm willing to to accommodate gym rules in order to play such a crazy great game (should be an olympic sport).My first eyewear was given to me by a friend, and I knew after a five-game series that this would be my first RB purchase (before a better racquet, etc.). The eyewear he gave me fogged and was blurry... I couldn't really even play and wanted to just take the damn things off (but couldn't). It was like playing with blinders.So I read up on RB eyewear and decided on these... it's been nine months of heavy-duty play (we play 90-120 minutes for 5-7 games three times a week... there is no dry material on my body at the end of the matches). These have been awesome... crystal clear focus (I normally wear glasses but not for RB), no fog ever (I sweat heavily), no scratches (I wash them before every series and dry them on whatever I have handy). They have adjustable length earpieces and a hearty closed-cell foam band across the entire length of the frame (keeps sweat from running into your eyes).The only negative is that there are cracks in the lens... several small ones that emanate from the nose piece... but they haven't spread and they don't interfere in play at all...

I have had a hard time with toys before, but this one definitely ranks near the top.First I put in batteries and turn the switch to on. Nothing happens. I put in newly charged batteries, nothing happens. I put in brand new duracells, nothing happens. This might sounds straightforward, but putting batteries in this thing is nothing of the sort. I wondered why there was two screws on the battery lid instead of the normal one on most toys. Its because the force required to press and keep the lid down is like trying to close a suitcase that has two times too many clothes in it. Absurd!Finally, like some others here, I hooked it up to the computer thinking maybe it needed to 'activate' or some such nonsense. The thing turned right on!!! At least it wasn't broken, I thought. After transferring some mp3s, I read the instruction manual thinking maybe there was a trick.The instruction manual was completely USELESS. It had a small diagram of the unit and told how to plug in the USB cable and that's it.I unplugged from the computer and turned the unit on. Nothing. I thought maybe it takes a while to boot up. So I waited a bit. Nothing. Out of frustration I hit the play button thinking that might be the key, voila!! It turned on!!!That's right, on a toy so simply made you could potentially give it to your 2 year old, they make the prerequisite for playing songs, the holding down of the green button after the switch is turned on. So what looks deceptively like the perfect toddler toy is actually a monster of complexity in disguise with a feature that completely kills the ease of use otherwise. However, even 2 year olds are pretty smart with electronics, I'm sure she'll figure it out.Another tip, but if you press and hold the green button while the unit is on, it will shutdown. That's right, press the Green ON button to shutdown!!!I'm reluctant to give this more than two stars because its extremely unlikely that more than 20% of the people who buy this thing will figure out all of the above. I feel sorry for the folks who think the only way to turn this thing on is to plug it into the computer. However, I'm going to go with three, because once I figured all of this out, I know my 2 year old is going to love it, and it will make my wife happy that she's not putting CDs in her boombox and playing music that way anymore."],[0.0,0.0,[1.0,2.0,[],[0.6893725533887989,0.3106274466112012]],"Bought this for my fiance who loves old school Twista - really old school Hip Hop in general.

Why not? Because this truck has a very vulnerable Achilles Tendon that kills the fun.First, the good:  This truck is a very solid performer, easily able to stand against Traxxas's 4WD Stampede.  This truck is actually more user friendly than the 'pede thanks to it's AVC feature.  Turning this feature up stabilizes the truck, at the cost of slight performance reduction.  To share a personal experience about it, I drive this truck with the AVC turned off for maximum performance.  My sister's boyfriend came and watched me drive it.  He had never driven a hobby grade RC, and was very timid when I handed him the transmitter.  He felt the truck was too much for him, so I turned on the AVC.  With the AVC, he quickly gained confidence and had a blast driving it.Now....that Achilles tendon.......is the four drive shafts from the differentials to the wheels.  Vaterra decided to forego traditional dogbone style shafts, and went with telescoping drive shafts.  Plastic drive shafts.  Brittle plastic drive shafts that break easily, even when puttering around on flat ground.  Horizon Hobby has been wonderful about replacing them for me, but I don't like working on the truck every time or every other time I drive it!  A CVD system for this truck is in the works, and I fervently hope that this rectifies this issue.So..... I will happily recommend this truck IF you don't mind constantly replacing driveshafts while you wait for the CVD replacement system to be released,  as this truck truly is a blast to drive for botn beginners and experienced drivers.  If you don't want to deal with the drive shafts, then I suggest watching and waiting for improvements to be made to the drive train."],[1.0,1.0,[1.0,2.0,[],[0.07717048094198513,0.9228295190580148]],"My daughter is 5 months and loves her Sophie.

After using the Melitta cone and Clever Coffee Dripper for awhile (which are also great products), I decided to give the Hario cone another try as I wanted to get away from using plastic cones.  The Hario happens to sit perfectly on the small four cup carafe that I use. The advantages of the Hario are the porcelain construction helps to keep the coffee hotter longer, and this cone just brews a superior cup of coffee.  I can make two cups as we do not like real strong coffee (I use one level Hario scoop per 12 oz. of water - which seems to be about half the coffee others recommend); therefore, the Size 02 just holds my two scoops of coffee and after a 30 second blooming period, I stir the grounds then use the slow circular pour method with a glass Pyrex measuring cup being careful not to pour above the top of the grounds (water at 198-200 degrees).  As I have to refill the Pyrex once with a second 12 ozs. of water, it helps to keep everything nice and hot (I also cover the top of the cone and Pyrex with plastic lids to preserve heat); stir once again during the last fill. The result is two perfect mugs of coffee every time.  I haven't timed the process, but I think it takes about 5 to 6 minutes from start to finish.

One is a tennis player and one is a pretty creepy guy with \"big ideas\" (read: the enemy), they hit it off pretty well, but the second man turns out to get too involved with his ideas and ends up killing the tennis player's wife for him after the tennis player nonchalantly mentions he wouldn't mind having her out of the way.  Now it's a rush to see what the tennis player will do now that he's a suspect and the other man keeps appearing to urge him to kill the stalker's father, via an agreement he didn't make.So it's basically all of Hitchcock's usual fare...  a man on the run, wrongly accused; a man blackmailing him; bumbling cops; a woman who wants to figure it out but doesn't know who to trust initially before fully trusting the protagonist; and old ladies who giggle over discussions of murder.This time I don't buy it, though.  The whole lighter thing comes off as a real gimmick to me (even when the stalker guy drops it in the grate... after the initial suspense, it doesn't matter anyway 'cause he's waiting for dusk.)  I couldn't believe that there isn't some way the protagonist couldn't have gone to the police and proven that he wasn't guilty, if anything because of the two characters they were.  The drunken professor was a useless side-note.  This movie is all of Hitchcock's stuff, but none of his experimentation which is really the stuff I like.In all, this is the most suspensful of his movies, but I can't gather up the energy to care for it.  Once again, I have an issue with the characters.  I'm just so used to Hitchcock telling me the same story over and over again that frankly I'm beginning to feel like he's repeating himself.  The guy had a few recurring themes, sure, but this is starting to fall into merely obsessive pondering of the many different ways to present the same internal fear Hitchcock has of being wrongfully imprisoned.  And with each movie of his I see, instead of said fear making me feel like I'm seeing some auteur at work, I'm beginning to see a guy who needs to relax a little.  I like his much more experimental stuff, where he plays with camera and imagery and narrative and design.

I was so impressed with it that I immediately went out and bought two of them.  I wound up giving the extra one I purchased to a friend who also loves it. Therefore, when this T-fal came up for review, I wanted to see how it compared to my Cuisinart.After using this machine a couple of times, I would have rated this T-fal 3-1/2 to 4 stars had I not already owned the Cuisinart.  However, because I am use to such an exceptional ice cream maker, I find this one just okay, so that is why it gets a plain three star-rating from me.PROS- It makes one quart of good ice cream (my Cuisinart makes two quarts)- I made both the strawberry ice cream and the lemon sorbet. The ice cream was good. The lemon sorbet came out excellent; although I was surprised the recipe did not call for heating the egg white.  (My Cuisinart recipe uses water instead of egg white.)- I consider the currently listed price of $34.99 reasonable and it's less than half the price of the Cuisinart I purchased.- This machine is quieter than my Cuisinart.CONS- The ice cream recipes are not exceptional.  Although my strawberry ice cream came out good, it was not as creamy or sweet as the recipe that came with my Cuisinart and it tasted icy or more like sorbet. The recipes that came with my Cuisinart are outstanding and a bit more flavorful and probably more calories too.  For instance, the T-fal strawberry ice cream recipe calls for strawberries, powdered sugar, lemon, and heavy cream.  My Cuisinart recipe also includes adding whole milk and vanilla extract and it uses regular sugar instead of powdered and calls for about  more sugar than the T-fal recipe. I did not mark it down for this because this has nothing to do with the ice cream maker itself and recipe books can always be purchased.- The chute on the cover is a little too small so it is not as easy to pour in the ingredients without messing up the top.- Assembling and disassembling the unit is \"sticky\" and tricky.  I had trouble removing the freezer bowl from the base because there is no grip when pulling straight up.  Even lining up the top and locking that in place was cumbersome; although after several tries I have that down well.  The paddle also requires a good push to get it into the motor but now seats easily.- The instructions for cleaning are not adequate.  There are actually 6 parts to this ice cream maker (as opposed to the 5 parts shown in the instructions).  My Cuisinart only has 4 parts.  In order to clean everything but the motor, I had to dissemble all parts. Getting the bowl out of the base is the most difficult.  However, I had to dissemble the lid after making ice cream because the ice cream got stuck in the crevices of the top.  I did not have to do this after the sorbet.  The lid coms apart easily as long as I flexed it when I pulled it away from the nubs holding it in place.- In my opinion, the bowl takes up an odd amount of space in my freezer compared to my Cuisinart. My Cuisinart 2-QT bowl is totally cylindrical and measures 7-3/4 inches wide by 6-3/4 inches tall.  This T-fal 1-QT bowl is flared at the top and measures 5-1/2 inches wide at the very bottom to about 9-1/2 wide at the top due to the handles.  It also measures 6-1/2 inches tall.No matter what machine one chooses, making ice cream is messy and requires prior preparation because of the cooking instructions and the fact that time is needed in the freezer for the ice cream to harden. Also making ice cream usually costs more than buying the pre-made product. The joy I get from making my own home-made product, however, far outweighs these caveats.In summary, although I cannot attest to the longevity of this machine, I think this is a decent ice cream maker for making small quantities of ice cream.  Had I not owned a Cuisinart, I would have been more pleased with this machine.  However, the cumbersome assembly and disassembly is the main reason it is a three star machine to me.PS For those who are interested, I pasted a link to my Cuisinart review in the comments section of this evaluation."],[1.0,1.0,[1.0,2.0,[],[0.07132306829350785,0.9286769317064921]],"This is a darling salt and pepper shaker set that we bought to go with our Halloween tablecloth.

This one definitely attracts ants as opposed to other brands that just don't have any effect on them. It helped me figure out where is the colony because of ant trail. Before putting it out I had no idea what is the source. Luckily ants were coming from under the baseboard in bathroom behind toilet bowl. I put these just in front of the ant hole. Ant stormed on them and didn't bother coming any further so no ant was seen in rest of the house as long as we have the baits in front of the colony. It seems to work because ants went crazy on it for 2 days and then disappeared, after 2 days new batch of ants went crazy on them. I kept replacing with new bait stations. It has been going on for 3 weeks and 5/6 generations of ants have been fed on my expense. I am not sure if this killing them or I am having ant farm. I have read mostly positive reviews of this product and am so disappointed that it is not working for us. Ants for sure disappears for 2 days before new one comes. Also, they move very slowly just before disappearing implying they had been effected by poison. So this product is worth trying.Finally, when last batch was wreaking havoc on the bait I generously sprayed windex (glass cleaner) on them and on the nest. It killed them on contact and I made sure that a lot of windex gets seeped into the nest. It has been 4 days since, no more ants so far. I think I will stick with windex until I get another solution. Any advice?Am I attracting ants from different colonies? But source of trail is always the same place, the hole behind bowl. Can there be multiple colonies in the walls or ground but ants are showing up from same hole because I put bait in front of it? To counter that problem I am going to put cinnamon sticks in front of that hole as it has worked for another hole in the house. No ants are seen coming out of bedroom hole that is stucked with cinnamon sticks for 2 months now. On unrelated note, I have killed 5 ants that looked like queens a couple of weeks ago.

Being able to scan 12 35mm slides and four to six photos at a time is a tremendous time saver.If you expect to load the film in the scanner and push one button and have the scanner/software do the rest, you will be disappointed. If you are willing to do a minimal amount of work you can get excellent results in a reasonable amount of time.As of February 2012 all the delivered software will install on Windows 7. I installed all the software on a Windows 7 64 Bit Professional system and had no problems. I also has no problems with crashes or other software malfunctions while using the software.As mentioned in other reviews the provided documentation is extremely minimal and using the scanner/software requires extension experimentation and trial and order. Two sites providing detailed technical reviews of the scanner and software which I found useful are:[...]I used the Epson software for all my scanning. I tried the provided Silverfast SW and a trial version of VueScan but found that the Epson software best took advantage of the features of the V700 scanner. With the other software I could never scan 12 slides of multiple photos in one scan. The Silverfast web site indicates that they will provide a free upgrade to their latest version, but they haven't updated that version for the V700 so I did not bother with it.I scanned my slides and 35 mm film strips at 4800 DPI to JPEG files with the Epson software using the HOME mode with color restoration enabled. As far as I can determine the Home Mode is the only mode that allows you to scan 12 slides or multiple film strips at one time. The Professional mode seems to only allow you to scan one slide at a time. It took 10 to 15 minutes to scan 12 slides at 4800 DPI. The automatic marqueeing or outlining seemed to work pretty well in this mode. I used the Prescan option to check the images before final scanning.The slide numbering scheme in the slide holder is9  5  1  White dots10  6  211  7  312  8  4For scanning slides, negatives or film strips the document mat should be removed.I scanned my photographs with the Epson software using the Professional mode. I scanned the photos at 1200 DPI to JPEG files with color restoration enabled. The Professional Mode allows you to scan multiple photos in one scan. I was able to scan four to six photos in one scan using this mode depending on the size of the photos. After the photos are Pre-Scanned it is necessary to marquee or outline them manually before final scanning. However, the Epson software remembers the marquees or outlines from  scan to scan so if you place the photos in the same position from scan to scan you can minimize the manual marqueeing usually having to adjust only one of them. It takes about three to four minutes to scan six photos at 1200 DPI.The Home mode allows you to scan multiple photos without manual outlining or marqueeing but does not allow photoshop like correction to be made during the scan.The photo numbering scheme for six photos is;TOP2  14  36  5For scanning photographs or documents the document mat should be installed.I did a Web search to determine what DPI to use for scanning. This search seemed to indicate that for archiving slides or negatives 4000 DPI was sufficient and for photos 600 DPI was sufficient. The V700 seems to only scan at discrete DPI's so using anything other than what the Epson software provides(Silverfast or VueScan) results in software interpolation being done.If you want to verify what DPI your scanned picture are you can use Adobe Photoshop to do this:Open the digital image in PhotoshopSelect Image->Image SizeResolution will be shown in pixels per inch.Problems I had using the scanner and software:1. As another reviewer mentioned the software sometime has problems with imageswith dark borders. I had this problem with 4 or 5 slides and it requiredplaying around with different modes and options to get around the problem2. The colors in several of my photos/slides of red/orange sunsets did notscan properly. They came out too blue. I could never get Epson orSilverfast to scan them properly. I had to use Photoshop to adjust thecolor and even then it did not correctly match the original.Summary:All in all the V700 scanner and software worked very well and I would recommend it.I did not find the Epson software to be terrible as some reviewers have indicated.I experienced no crashes or serious bugs when using the software. The Abort processing even worked correctly even though that is a feature that often doesn't work properly."],[0.0,0.0,[1.0,2.0,[],[0.6730771147574881,0.32692288524251184]],"I chose this item after reading other reviews.

I'm a fan of the entire series from \"King of All Monsters\" to \"Final Wars\". I own every film available on DVD, I own the video games, I own quite a few of the soundtracks on CD and I will be the first in line when \"vs. Biollante\", \"vs. Megalon\" and \"1985\" hit DVD and pay whatever is asked just so I can complete my collection. Yes, I can even sit through the Matthew Broderick travesty that bears the name \"Godzilla\".That being said....I'm not sure how anyone, fan or non-fan, can enjoy \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\"???? This film is so astonishingly awful, it veers way off of the \"So Bad It's Good\" track onto the simply horrible realm at about 20 minutes in. I love bad b-movies, I'll sit back and watch \"Mesa of Lost Women\" or \"Eegah\" all day long, but \"Kong vs Godzilla\" is mind numblingly awful. Where to begin....1. King Kong does not look like \"King Kong\". This ratty ape suit looks like it's barely holding together, and the nightmarishly barely animated hand-puppet face used for close ups of the giant ape is grade school level F/X at best.2. While having a strong plot isn't exactly key to a successful Godzilla film, Kong's storyline is so minimal as to not exist. Basically a company has found out these island berries can get you intoxicated, so they want to steal them. Unfortunately they happen to be King Kong's drink of choice as well. So basically the events of the film occur because some Japanese folks and King Kong both want to get high! Godzilla only gets involved because the worlds worst submarine captain doesn't understand that iceburgs don't simply float on top of the water, and that most of the ice is actually below the water's surface, thus ramming his nuclear sub into Godzilla's ice prison.3. The UN / American footage. I don't know if watching the original Japanese version of this film would help much, but the American version with the narrator/UN report guy is amazingly dull. For some reason there is a space station shown, and some maps, a Japanese correspondant who doesn't know how to wear headphones....and everybody is watching the events unfold on a 10\" color TV screen? The American scientist is awful as well, you have to love when he holds up a small gumball and states that it is the size of Godzilla's brain??? What???4. The fight scenes are dull. If nothing else you can usually rely on Toho films to provide some decent monster fights in their films...not so much here. Sure Godzilla and Kong meet for a final showdown about 10 minutes before the film ends...but it's just bad...and worse there really isn't a conclusion.Luckily, Godzilla would go on to much better things after this third entry in the series.

NOT a garbage COMMA truck transformer. A waste management garbage truck transformer. I know, just take a minute to let the awesome sink in. Transformer Animate Wreck-gar is a great toy. His color palette of oranges, tomato reds, grays and ochres are a homage to his original G1 character. The truck is nice example of the translation from Animated's visual stylizing to physical toy. I especially the lifting arms gimmick on the front. I only wish the truck windows had been rendered in clear plastic, which shouldn't have been hard to do since it's a solid non transforming facade. (also the headlights and tail lights are transparent plastic with paint apps over them?!)The transformation is easy, but my Wreck-gar is pretty solid when pegged together and stiff in some joints so he might be more difficult for younger hands. Again your Wreck-gar may vary. He basically transforms out of his truck back which becomes a backpack in robot mode. Since it actually *was* a backpack in the show, this is one of the few cases of a backpack-former where it makes sense. I wish the door on the back of his truck mode opened so he could actually use the 'backpack' in robot mode like on the show. But, the storage of his weapons in a hidden pocket kinda make up for the backpack issues Robot mode is sweet. Captures the characterization perfectly down to the little details, crooked smirk, robo-facial hair and antenna on his TV head. Fairly poseable with articulated hands, and the light piping in the eyes works amazingly better than I expected. Oddly he only displays an Autobot symbol in vehicle mode.All in all, Animated Wreck-gar is a good solidly build and cleverly designed figure. I'd recommend for kids, collectors, fans of the show, fans of Weird Al, garbage truck enthusiasts... He originally retailed for about 20 bucks and sometimes goes for around 40 MISB on some sites, but if you can find him for around 20-25 or so he's great quirky bot. \"Dare to be Stupid,\" Indeed!And remember parents: If you don't like challenging your children, BUY AGE APPROPRIATE."],[1.0,1.0,[1.0,2.0,[],[0.3552395948874422,0.6447604051125577]],"I use it primarily in my laser printer.

They are the Canon SX260 and this Panasonic ZS15.  In addition to high image quality (the most important feature IMO), both cameras are about the same size (large end of pocketable) and both have about the same optical zoom.  However, there are still reasons to choose the Panasonic ZS15.  The main reason for me (and the one most reviewers never mention) is the extra optical zoom up to 25x if you limit the image size to 5 MPix which is large enough for a quality 8x10 inch print.  Then there is an extra 2x zoom for a total of 50x which is apparently an interpolated digital zoom involving a little image quality degradation.  (The camera has a digital zoom in addition to the 50x which I never use.  I can use digital zoom on a computer after the fact.)  So, with 25x true optical zoom and the ability to get a shot at 50x if necessary, this is an amazing camera.  It has aperture and shutter priority settings as well as manual. These features are also important although the intelligent automatic mode (iA) does well in many conditions.  There is also an intelligent resolution feature which adds beautiful sharpness to many photos.  That feature is always present in iA and may be included in the other settings as well.There are three other features that made me choose the Panasonic ZS15.  1. It does not have a GPS which is a power draining option that I never use in a camera.  (I tend to know where my photos were taken - close enough.)  2. It does not shoot RAW which I never do.  3.

Welcome is one of the most creative disks in the Hard Rock genre. Unfortunately, they took a different direction after Welcome (October 2002) with Blue Sky Research (August 2005).2002's Welcome separated Taproot from the generic Nu Metal infestation of this decade with off-time beats most clearly heard in songs like Everything, Fault and Sumtimes. Poem was Welcome's claim to radio play and it was a great, foot stompin' rocker. There were different styles and sounds to the tunes on Welcome, and the songs didn't have the Nu Metal Nickelback epidemic of not being able to tell when the track has changed.Sure, Taproot clearly was influenced by Alice in Chains. In fact, Toby Wright, Welcome's producer, even co-produced some AiC disks. And singer Stephen Richards has an unmistakably clear singing voice that is a bit similar to the late, great Layne Staley.But Taproot were definitely their own band on Welcome and put out one of the most unique sounding hard rock disks of 2002.Unfortunately, Taproot lost some of their unique sound with Blue Sky Research, and went to the Nickelback monochromatic formula for some odd reason. My guess it was pressure from their label (Atlantic) to take the fun and creativity out of the music and make more radio friendly music (indeed they hired Billy Corgan [Smashing Pumpkins] to help with some of the Blue Sky tracks).This past summer drummer Jarrod Montague revealed on Taproot's MySpace blog that the band had parted ways with Atlantic Records. So hopefully Taproot's 4th release will get back to the music that made them unique and hard.Hard rockers looking for something mostly unique with a bit of an Alice in Chians Dirt influence should absolutely pick up Welcome."],[0.0,1.0,[1.0,2.0,[],[0.28813016677507863,0.7118698332249215]],"When we realized that we couldn't use it to make frozen tortoise bites, we just kind of tossed it somewhere.

My pouches do not have a continous belt so the loops that the suspenders come with do not just slide on.  I had to drill out the rivits on the loops and drill some holes in my pouches and rivit the metal part of the loop to my pouches.

Maybe it's really great, but this dehydrator, which costs approximately half of the Excalibur price after figuring in all the add-ons necessary to get it working, actually has the same features, and dare I say: even more.This model has ten trays. The Excalibur has nine. This model comes with two nonstick liners and a device to close off four trays' width for times when you want to take them out to place rising dough or culturing yogurt in it instead. You need to buy those things at extra cost for the Excalibur model.  Neither model has a timer. Both models have adjustable temperature.The STX does not heat up my kitchen.

So I did that, and after approximately 5 minutes the smell went away. It hasn't come back since. It is also very quiet.

Included on almost every important \"Best of\" list for 1976, Eastwood's amazing cinematic masterpiece was all but snubbed by the Academy. That he was finally recognized for the much-inferior \"Unforgiven\" is a shameful irony. The western genre was in decline by the 1970s and had largely devolved into cliche or cartoonish parody. The genius of Eastwood's vision was to take traditional western stereotypes and turn them on their heads, demythologize the rigidly black/white good-vs-evil Saturday matinee morality, and show us characters with real depth, real motivations and real inner conflicts; not always \"good\" or always \"bad\" but sometimes walking a fine line, driven to one side or the other by circumstances beyond one man's control. The look of the film is gorgeous, showing us a smokey, autumnal by-gone world, sometimes crude, often gritty. It's not clear we'd want to live in such a time or place, but we are drawn in nonetheless. Wonderful acting, and a whole passel of great character actors, including the inimitable Chief Dan George, bring the story to vibrant life. There's plenty of action to keep the adrenaline flowing, and the story draws to a logical, satisfying, if artfully understated, conclusion.

Shirley plays a talented orphan, Rebecca Winstead, who wins a radio contest, and despite some twists and turns in the plot, eventually finds stardom in New York.  The film closes with Shirley and Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson in a great tap routine to Raymond Scott's hit, \"The Toy Trumpet.\"  William Demarest, Gloria Stuart, Jack Haley, and Randolph Scott are among the featured character actors in the film.This film - in both B&W; and colorized versions - is a must-have for Temple fans of all ages.  It features English fake stereo and mono soundtracks, a Spanish soundtrack, and subtitles in both languages.

The basic game is similar to the old parlor game, where each player has to repeat what all the players have said up to him/her, then add a new word beginning with the next letter in the alphabet. This game is a lot more fun, though, because there are cards that tell each player what to do or say. Some are to act like a certain animal (silently or with sound effects), others are to say a phrase, others to act out a certain motion. I lost last time, because although I remembered to say, \"Seriously,\" then scratch my head, then imitate the sound and motion of a snake, then pretend to swim, then say, \"Gotcha!\" then take my own pulse, and then howl at the moon like a wolf, alas I forgot that the next item in the list was to pretend to juggle. My two 10-year olds beat me 10 to 9 to zero. At first, I thought the game was so simple that for adults it might best be considered a drinking game, but after that (and other) humiliation(s) I think I'll rest up and stay cold sober in the future.There is a board and a little piece for each player that moves around, depending on how well the player does, and there is nominally a \"winner,\" but really nobody cares much about that aspect, at least they shouldn't. The real value of the game is in the cards that give such a large variety of words and actions to remember. It's a good thing there are several hundred cards!It's probably worth noting that the game is geared completely towards having fun, and the directions, while complete, are quite casual (nobody \"loses\" or \"fails,\" they just \"mess up.\"). However, the game is quite educational too, as it helps concentration and (alert: non-scientific opinion coming) maybe makes people use different parts of their brains as they remember totally different types of things--verbal, visual, and auditory. That's really why I think the game will never grow old, as the sequences and significances of the things players need to remember will always be different, even though each individual card will eventually reappear.

I actually stumbled on this product at an Office Max store. I checked Amazon and their price was better. So I bought one and tried it. It took me less than a week to get used to the trackball and I simply fell in love with it. The fact that it has the same buttons as a regular mouse makes the transition a lot easier. Within a week, my wrist wasn't in pain anymore. So I bought a second one and I keep one at the office and the other one with my personal laptop. I love that I can use regular batteries for it (1 AA). The USB transmitter can be kept inside the battery compartment, which prevents you from misplacing it or losing it when travelling with it. I also love the range: I can control the pointer from across the room. My previous wireless mouse didn't have such a good range. For some people the range may be unimportant, but for people like me who sometimes have to facilitate presentations, a great range helps when you are not standing next to the computer.

It would be nice if there was a guide on each brush was and its purpose. Not only so makeup babies can feel like they know what they are doing, but also to make sure you got what you paid for.
